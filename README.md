# :cherry_blossom: Flowering and Fruiting Phenology 
Phenology is defined by the US/IBP Phenology Committee as *'the study of the rhythms of recurring biological events and their causes, influenced by both biotic and abiotic forces, and examining the interrelationship between phases of the same or different species.'* Flowering and fruiting phenology (FFP) are critical aspects of plant fitness, with important implications for ecological processes such as interspecific interactions (i.e. Competition, pollination and frugivory).
## Circular analysis
FFP as a periodic phenomenon can be best interpreted in terms of uniformity and directionality over time if appropriate analysis are use :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
