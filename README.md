# Flowering and Fruiting Phenology
Phenology is defined by the US/IBP Phenology Committee as 'the study of the rhythms of recurring biological events and their causes, influenced by both biotic and abiotic forces, and examining the interrelationship between phases of the same or different species.' Flowering and fruiting phenology are critical aspects of plant fitness, with important implications for ecological processes such as interspecific interactions (e.g. Competition, pollination, and frugivory).
